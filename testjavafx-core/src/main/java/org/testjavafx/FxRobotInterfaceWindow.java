 * <p>Calling these methods from the FX thread is safe.
 *
 * <p>Note that currently, the window methods are slightly different than
 * TestFX.  TestFX allows explicit setting and querying of the target window,
 * which can be confusing because it conflates the idea of the focused window
 * with the idea of setting a specific target window.
 * In TestJavaFX if you want the focused window, use {@link #focusedWindow()}
 * instead of the targetWindow() call to get the currently focused window.
 * If you want to target a specific window, use the {@link #from(Window)} call
 * to begin the query.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of this object to be returned from all the methods.
 *            This will be {@link FxRobotInterface} if you use these methods via
 *            {@link FxRobotInterface} or {@link FxRobot}.

     * Get the currently focused windows.  The reason for the plural is that

     * and all the popup windows as focused.  So the answer to which window
     * has focus can be none (e.g. if some other application has focus), one
     * (the most common case) or multiple (which should be related through
     * window ownership).
     * 
     * <p>There is an extra tweak for convenience.  Sometimes no window is focused, 
     * but in this case we generally want to access the most recent return of focusedWindows(),
     * so we return the values from the previous focusedWindows() call that
     * are still showing.  If none of this applies and there is only one window available
     * from {@link #listWindows()} we just return that as our best guess (but do not
     * remember it for the previous-call mechanism just mentioned).  If all else fails
     * we return the empty list.
     *
     * <p>This method is safe to call on the FX thread.  If called on another
     * thread it will block until it can its calculation on the FX thread.
     *
     * @return Our best guess at the current/recently-focused windows (see above) or
     *         empty if no such windows are available.  The return list is unmodifiable.
