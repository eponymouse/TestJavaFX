/**
 * A NodeQuery represents a search for a node (or set of nodes).  It
 * is created using methods in {@link FxRobot}.
 *
 * <p>A NodeQuery represents a potential search; nothing is actually executed until
 * the query methods are run.  This allows for thread-safety (all queries are
 * ultimately run on the FX thread) and for the {@link #queryWithRetry()} method
 * that retries if the node is not found.
 *
 * <p>This is different to TestFX, which runs the query immediately to get interim
 * results.  Another difference to TestFX is that in TestFX the methods on NodeQuery return
 * the same (but modified) object for chaining, but here a new NodeQuery object is
 * returned that represents the modified search.  NodeQuery in this TestJavaFX library
 * is immutable and can be re-run many times.
